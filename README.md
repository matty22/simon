# Simon

This game is a clone of the 1980s classic game, Simon! The user must remember and duplicate an increasingly long and difficult pattern. If s/he inputs the sequence incorrectly, the game will either give another chance or end, depending on the setting the user chose.

## To Use

First, choose if you want to play the game in 'Strict' mode. In non-strict mode, a player will get another chance if they enter the sequence incorrectly. In strict mode, the game will end immediately if the player inputs an incorrect sequence. Push Start to begin the game and push Reset to start over from the first sequence.
